## Overview:
AI Wargame1 is a 2-player strategy game featuring an attacker (A) and a defender (D) on a 5 Ã— 5 board. The objective is simple: destroy your opponent's AI unit to secure victory. Each player commands a team of 6 units with various types, including the powerful AI, offensive Viruses, defensive Techs, generic Programs, and sturdy Firewalls.

### Units and Combat:
- **AI (A):** The pivotal unit, with the game-winning potential. Protect your AI while targeting your opponent's.
- **Viruses (V):** Highly offensive units, capable of eliminating an AI with a single attack.
- **Techs (T):** Strong in defense, they engage in balanced combat with Viruses.
- **Programs (P):** Generic soldiers with average attributes.
- **Firewalls (F):** Robust against incoming attacks but less effective at dealing damage.

### Unit Health:
Each unit begins with a health level ranging from 0 to 9. All units start with full health (9). If a unit's health drops to or below 0, it's removed from the board. If your AI's health reaches 0, you lose the game.
